Data_Share
==========

This program collects data from multiple files and then shares it amongst the files. Suppose we have files A, B, C and D that consist of different data. We want all the files to share this data with each other so File A will also have the data from file B, C and D and so on with other files. 

The inspiration came from running multiple Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 servers at once. If a hacker joined one of my running servers and got banned then I had to copy their IP to all other server files too so that they don't join my other servers. It was taking too long manually but with just a click of a button this program does that (GUI Added).

If you can please suggest any improvements then please do. Please ask me if you have any questions.

Thank you :D
