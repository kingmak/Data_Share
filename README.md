Data_Share

This program collects data from multiple files and then shares it amongst the files. Suppose we have files A, B, C and D that consist of different data. We want all the files to share this data with each other so File A will also have the data from file B, C and D and so on with other files. This is what the program is doing.

The inspiration came from running multiple Call of Duty Modern Warfare 2 servers at once. If a hacker joined one of my running servers and got banned then I had to copy their IP to all other server files too so that they don't join my other servers. It was taking too long manually thus this program was created.

If you find any improvements then please do tell me. Also please let me know if you have any questions.

Thank you :D

[LAUNCH INDEX.PYW TO RUN THE PROGRAM]

Possible Order of Operation:

1) Click on Add New File Path
2) Repeat This Step Until All the File Paths Are Added, or Go To Setup 3
3) Once All File Paths Are Added Hit Copy Data and the Data Will be Shared

** When deleting File Paths, the Text File that contains the paths pops us, so we have to remove them manually :( (possible improvement: make the file path removal process be automated [click of buttons])

** The Data can be anything but in the example files folder there are 3 files where use names as data. Try using those files to understand what the program is doing. Thank you again.
